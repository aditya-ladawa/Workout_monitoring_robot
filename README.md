# Workout Monitoring Robot: A Robotic Approach for Real-Time Workout Monitoring and Guidance

## Please note: The complete project is in the OS inside the robot (Raspberry pi 5). This repo includes only the code files. Since, The complete project is big in size, its hard to copy all files from the Raspberry pi.

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the **Workout Monitoring Robot**, a cutting-edge robotic system designed to monitor and guide users during their workout routines. The robot leverages advanced technologies such as **Human Pose Estimation**, **Autonomous Robot Navigation**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to provide real-time feedback, posture correction, and interactive guidance, revolutionizing the way individuals engage in physical fitness activities.

The project aims to enhance the effectiveness and safety of workouts by offering a personalized and interactive fitness assistant that can operate autonomously, ensuring users maintain proper form and avoid injuries.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Pose Estimation**: Utilizes computer vision and machine learning to analyze user posture during exercises and provide instant feedback.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Equipped with Arduino-based navigation and obstacle avoidance for seamless movement during workouts.
- **Natural Language Interaction**: Enables users to interact with the robot using voice commands and receive verbal instructions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Features an LCD screen and speakers for clear communication and guidance.
- **Data Management**: Uses MySQL and file storage to manage user records, workout history, and instructional materials.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Implements robust algorithms for navigation, pose estimation, and exercise error analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Hardware**: Arduino, Camera, Microphone, Speakers, LCD Screen
- **Software**: Python, OpenCV, MySQL, NLP Libraries
- **Machine Learning**: Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition
- **Navigation**: Autonomous Robot Navigation, Obstacle Avoidance

## Future Work
- **Optimize Object Detection**: Improve efficiency and accuracy using model quantization and hardware acceleration.
- **Adaptive Tracking**: Develop algorithms to adjust to changes in object appearance and motion.
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Incorporate data from depth cameras or IMUs for enhanced detection and tracking.
- **Domain-Specific Applications**: Explore applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, and autonomous vehicles.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Develop more intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for broader adoption.
